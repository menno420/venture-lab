## ⚠️ Gate carve-outs (host additions the kit-owned regen could not keep)

- carve-out: .github/workflows/substrate-gate.yml — host-added step 'uses: actions/checkout@v4' in job 'substrate-gate'
- carve-out: .github/workflows/substrate-gate.yml — host-added step 'uses: actions/setup-python@v5' in job 'substrate-gate'
- carve-out: full pre-regen gate banked at .substrate/backup/substrate-gate.pre-regen-4f50eb4d.yml — host additions were NOT carried into the regenerated kit-owned gate; move them into a separate workflow file (e.g. .github/workflows/host-ci.yml) and commit that before shipping this upgrade/adopt PR.

## Carve-out scan

- carve-out scan: 3 carve-out line(s) reported above (see the ⚠️ section).
