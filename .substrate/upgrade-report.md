## Capability-ledger seed refresh

- capability-seed: docs/CAPABILITIES.md carries no kit-owned seed fence and its seed section does not match the old template — hand-adopt once: replace your discovery-rule + Capabilities/Walls seed sections with the fenced block (BEGIN/END markers) from the new template, keeping your append log below it; afterwards upgrades refresh the fence automatically.

This upgrade ships the venue-scoped capability ledger (grounded-skills §4.2): entries carry a venue token (owner-live · autonomous-project · routine-fired · subagent · any) and the ledger's kit-owned seed block carries the posture decision rule. If this repo carries a local prose copy of the boot-triad/venue-posture rule (superbot Q-0270), that copy is now superseded by docs/CAPABILITIES.md's posture rule — collapse the local copy into a pointer.

## Seat-digest refresh

- seat-digest: docs/seat-digest.md already current — nothing to refresh.

## Applied (--apply-docs)

- applied: CONSTITUTION.md (template@new, hash re-recorded)
- applied: docs/AGENT_ORIENTATION.md (template@new, hash re-recorded)
- applied: docs/SKILLS.md (template@new, hash re-recorded)

 The `kit:` line is your kit self-report (substrate-coordinator visibility): keep the version in
