## Capability-ledger seed refresh

- capability-seed: docs/CAPABILITIES.md fence already current — nothing to refresh.

This upgrade ships the venue-scoped capability ledger (grounded-skills §4.2): entries carry a venue token (owner-live · autonomous-project · routine-fired · subagent · any) and the ledger's kit-owned seed block carries the posture decision rule. If this repo carries a local prose copy of the boot-triad/venue-posture rule (superbot Q-0270), that copy is now superseded by docs/CAPABILITIES.md's posture rule — collapse the local copy into a pointer.

## Seat-digest refresh

- seat-digest: NOT regenerated — docs/seat-digest.md differs from the last kit-written render (hand-edited, or no hash recorded). It is a derived render, never a copy of record: move any real finding into the capability ledger / skill index, then regenerate with `python3 bootstrap.py seat-digest` (overwrites this file only; the sources are untouched).
