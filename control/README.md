# control/ — manager↔lane coordination protocol

> **Status:** `binding` — seeded 2026-07-09 by the fleet manager. One writer per
> file (playbook R9); violating writer-ownership is the only way this protocol
> merge-conflicts.

## The two files

| File | Writer | Semantics |
|---|---|---|
| [`inbox.md`](inbox.md) | **MANAGER ONLY** | Append-only orders. The lane NEVER edits this file — not to ack, not to mark done, not to fix typos. |
| [`status.md`](status.md) | **LANE ONLY** | Overwritten by the lane each session. The manager touches it exactly once: this bootstrap stub. |

## Inbox semantics — `status: new` stays `new`

Orders in the inbox keep `status: new` **in the file forever** — the manager
does not flip them and neither do you. To see what is unexecuted, **diff the
inbox against your own `status.md`**: any order number not listed as
acked/done in your status is new work. (Gen-1 lanes without this rule either
re-executed finished orders or waited for a status flip that never came.)

## The standing ritual (every session, every wake)

1. **FIRST:** `git fetch origin main`; read `control/inbox.md` **AT HEAD** —
   never from a stale clone (R1). Diff against your status. Claim an order
   before building.
2. **HEARTBEAT BEFORE WORK:** your first commit is the session card / a
   status WIP line. A silent session is indistinguishable from a dead one.
3. Act on orders; ambiguous orders go under ⚑ needs-owner in your status —
   then do the rest, don't stall.
4. **LAST:** overwrite `control/status.md` — timestamp (`date -u`), phase,
   health, last-shipped PR, blockers, orders acked/done, ⚑ needs-owner.
   **Re-read `control/inbox.md` at HEAD immediately before this final write**
   and ack anything new — the measured miss class is a lane that heartbeated
   15 minutes after an order landed without seeing it (fleet ping test,
   2026-07-09).

## Rules that ride the protocol

- **Re-read the inbox at HEAD before acting AND before any close-out** (R19 —
  the ORDER-number race cost the fleet 2 PRs twice in one day).
- **Report progress ONLY in `status.md`** — never in the inbox, never only in
  chat (chat evaporates; git is the evidence, R2).
- **All timestamps from `date -u`**, never from the model's sense of time —
  the fleet ping sweep caught two lanes stamping local-time-as-Z.
- A no-op wake (no new orders) costs at most a heartbeat line in status —
  never a full PR round.
