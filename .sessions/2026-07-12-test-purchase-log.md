# Session — SWTK owner test purchase (record the end-to-end buyer path)

> **Status:** `complete`

- **📊 Model:** opus-4.8 · high · test-purchase-log
- **session:** record the last open leg of the SWTK launch — the owner
  completed a discounted **test purchase** of the $29 Stripe Webhook Test Kit
  on Gumroad, walking the end-to-end buyer path (checkout → receipt →
  download). Append a verified-test-purchase entry to
  `docs/launch/stripe-webhook-test-kit/LAUNCH-LOG.md` (success banner shown,
  download page served the `stripe-webhook-test-kit-v0.1` ZIP, 19.4 KB, working
  Download button), mark the launch hour FULLY complete (⚑A PR #74 · ⚑E PR #84
  · article PR #85 · this test purchase) and the launch now in MEASUREMENT mode
  (checkpoints 2026-07-19 / 2026-07-26 armed coordinator-side). Correct the
  earlier "ZERO tags" note — the article's 4 tags (stripe, debugging, webhooks,
  payments) went live 2026-07-12T17:24:24Z (dev.to API); the earlier fetch
  raced the owner's edit. Update `control/status.md` SURGICALLY (test-purchase
  row → VERIFIED 2026-07-12; launch state → measurement mode). Never touch
  `control/inbox.md`. Never record the owner's email address.

## ⟲ Previous-session review

Previous-session review: the article-publish-log slice
(`.sessions/2026-07-12-article-publish-log.md`, PR #85) recorded the free
gotcha article going LIVE on dev.to (the funnel top) and left exactly one owner
click open on the T→T+14 clock — a first **test purchase** to de-risk the
end-to-end buyer path — with its LAUNCH-LOG row explicitly UNCONFIRMED. That
slice also recorded the article as rendering with **ZERO tags** at its fetch
time (2026-07-12T17:24:10Z). This slice closes the last open leg: the owner has
now completed a test purchase, so the buyer path is verified end to end, and it
corrects the tag record — the 4 tags went live at 17:24:24Z (the earlier fetch
raced the owner's edit).

## 💡 Session idea

Record the last owner click on the launch clock durably on `main`: a completed
end-to-end **test purchase** (checkout → receipt → download, 19.4 KB ZIP served
by a working Download button). Append a verified-purchase entry to the
LAUNCH-LOG, flip the launch hour to FULLY complete (all four legs — ⚑A #74, ⚑E
#84, article #85, test purchase), move the launch into MEASUREMENT mode
(checkpoints 2026-07-19 / 2026-07-26 armed coordinator-side), and correct the
earlier ZERO-tags note (4 tags live 17:24:24Z, verified via dev.to API). Ride
the proven self-landing path: born-red card first, flip to `complete` only
after `check --strict` is green, open a READY (not draft) `claude/`-headed PR
so the enabler arms squash auto-merge server-side. NEVER arm or merge my own
PR. Do NOT touch `control/inbox.md`. NEVER record the owner's email.

## Scope

- Append to `docs/launch/stripe-webhook-test-kit/LAUNCH-LOG.md` in its existing
  style: a verified owner test-purchase entry (timestamp, what was verified —
  success banner, download page served the `stripe-webhook-test-kit-v0.1` ZIP,
  19.4 KB, working Download button, checkout→receipt→download confirmed) and a
  line marking the launch hour complete (all four legs) + MEASUREMENT mode.
- Correct the earlier "ZERO tags" note in the LAUNCH-LOG: the article's 4 tags
  (stripe, debugging, webhooks, payments) went live 2026-07-12T17:24:24Z
  (dev.to API); the earlier fetch raced the owner's edit.
- Update `control/status.md` SURGICALLY (overwrite-last, after a final inbox
  re-read at HEAD): test-purchase row → VERIFIED 2026-07-12; launch state →
  measurement mode (checkpoints 2026-07-19 / 2026-07-26 armed coordinator-side).
- Add this session card, born-red first, flip to `complete` before the PR.
- `python3 bootstrap.py check --strict` green before push.
- Do NOT touch `control/inbox.md`, the article content, or `candidates/`. NEVER
  record the owner's email address.

## Work log

- Boot hard-sync: existing clone, `git fetch origin && git reset --hard
  origin/main`; `git ls-remote origin main` and `git rev-parse HEAD` both
  `2cf81cd` (PR #85). Read `control/inbox.md` (NEVER edited): highest order is
  **ORDER 007** (2026-07-12T08:30Z); no order newer than 007.

## Status / outcome

Complete. Recorded the last open leg of the SWTK launch: the owner completed a
discounted **end-to-end test purchase** of the $29 Stripe Webhook Test Kit on
Gumroad (owner click). Appended a verified-test-purchase entry to
`docs/launch/stripe-webhook-test-kit/LAUNCH-LOG.md` — timestamp
`Sun Jul 12 18:09:34 UTC 2026`, success banner shown, download page served the
`stripe-webhook-test-kit-v0.1` ZIP (**19.4 KB**, working Download button),
checkout→receipt→download verified; the owner's email deliberately NOT recorded.
Marked the **launch hour COMPLETE end to end** (⚑A PR #74 · ⚑E PR #84 · article
PR #85 · this test purchase) and the launch now in **MEASUREMENT mode**
(checkpoints 2026-07-19 / 2026-07-26 armed coordinator-side). Corrected the
earlier "ZERO tags" note: the article's 4 tags (stripe, debugging, webhooks,
payments) went LIVE **2026-07-12T17:24:24Z** (dev.to API) — the earlier
17:24:10Z fetch raced the owner's edit; the tags ARE live and no tagging
follow-up is needed. Updated `control/status.md` surgically (test-purchase row
→ **VERIFIED 2026-07-12**, launch state → **measurement mode**), overwritten
LAST after a final `control/inbox.md` re-read at HEAD (highest order still 007,
no order newer than 007). Born-red card first, flipped `complete` as the last
content commit; `python3 bootstrap.py check --strict` green (exit 0) at flip.
`control/inbox.md` untouched. Landed via a READY `claude/`-headed PR — self-lands
on green via the enabler (the lane never arms/merges its own PR).
