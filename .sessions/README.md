# Session logs

Per-session logs live here as `<date>-<slug>.md`, newest first. Create the log as the session's FIRST commit with a born-red status (`> **Status:** `in-progress``) so in-flight work is visible to parallel sessions, then flip it to `complete` as the deliberate LAST step once the close-out is written — a half-done session never reads as finished. Before it counts as complete, a log must carry these markers: Status badge, Session idea, Previous-session review, Model line.

If the card is missing at session end, the kit **auto-drafts** one from evidence (files touched, git HEAD movement, the verify command); an in-progress card missing its close-out gets the drafted section appended. A draft is a starting point, not a close-out: verify the evidence, resolve every `[[fill:]]` slot, then flip the Status badge — unresolved slots (and the `drafted` status) keep the card counting incomplete.

**Guard recipes:** when a card records friction-to-guard material for a *later* session (a deferred fix, a flagged footgun), carry a one-line **guard recipe** naming the code anchors — function + file + the test target — not just the symptom. A symptom-only entry costs the next session a re-derivation grep pass; a recipe lets it land the guard in minutes.
