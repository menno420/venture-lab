# Review queue — post-merge review ledger

> **Status:** `living-ledger` — the merge-then-flag half of the self-merge
> grant ([`conventions.md`](conventions.md) rule 3; fleet-manager PR #10
> merge-authority policy). Nothing waits for review: PRs merge on green, and
> anything a reviewer should re-check gets a row here (and/or a Codex
> @-mention on the PR). Review is post-merge; veto = revert. An empty queue
> with all PRs merged is the healthy state.

| PR | What to re-check | Why |
